        {
          "stepNumber": 1,
          "instruction": "First you will make the curry paste. This can be made ahead, and set in the fridge overnight for the flavours to meld. I often double the recipe and put an airtight jarful in the freezer for later use."
        },
        {
          "stepNumber": 2,
          "instruction": "Heat a small saucepan on medium, then add 2 Tablespoons of coconut oil to the pan and allow to melt. Add the onion pieces and cook, stirring until they are translucent and sweet smelling. Next add the minced garlic, ginger and measured spices to the pan and stir continually for 1-2 minutes. This quick toasting releases the volatile oils and aromas of the spices, adding to the flavor of the finished paste. The seasoning of this dish is adaptable to your liking. By following the instructions you will get a bit of heat, and a flavorful curry. By increasing the quantity of chili powder, or adding extra cayenne pepper you will get more heat. By adding more curry powder or fresh curry leaves you will intensify the curry flavours. I prefer the warm, bright and pungent flavours of garam masala (\u201chot mixture\u201d) spices of cloves, caraway, cardamom and fennel, so it is emphasized in this particular recipe. Make it your own, according to your preference and tastes. "

          "instruction": "Finally, add the chopped tomato pieces and allow the sauce to come to a boil. Reduce heat and cook down until tomatoes are softened, about 10 minutes or so. If you are in deep Spring, you can also substitute the tomatoes for green bell peppers, and they will act much the same, but may release less water so you may want to add an extra tablespoon of water or broth to the pan. Stir the sauce every couple minutes so the tomatoes do not stick to the pan or burn. The mixture is ready when the sauce liquid has reduced and the tomatoes have released their skins. Turn off the burner and set the paste aside to cook for a few minutes. Once cooled slightly, pour red chili mixture into a food processor and blend until it becomes a smooth paste."

Set it aside, and with a clean knife, hands and board, prepare your vegetables. Mince the garlic and ginger, chop the tomato and zucchini separately, remove stems of kale leaves and tear them into bite sized pieces. You want your zucchini chunks to be about the size of the chicken pieces, so that everything cooks evenly and looks appealing for presentation. Now you are ready to cook! "
