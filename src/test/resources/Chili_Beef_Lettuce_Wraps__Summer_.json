          "instruction": "While beef cooks, mix together the fish sauce, chili sauce, and water in a small bowl. Zest the skin of the lime and squeeze the juice. (You may need two limes to get enough juice, but only use the zest from one lime.) Thinly slice the green onions and chop the cilantro. Most iceberg lettuce doesn\u2019t need washing, but remove the outer leaves. Cut out the core and cut the lettuce into quarters to make \"cups\" to hold the beef mixture."
